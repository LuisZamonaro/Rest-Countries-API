I found the project idea on the FrontendMentor website and built it to improve my skills with React, TypeScript, styled-components, among other technologies to be found in it.
To start the project, open the integrated terminal in the rest-countries-api folder located within the frontend folder, and type the command
  - yarn dev or
  -  npm run dev


The country data is contained in the data.json file inside the src folder.
